# Accessibility UX Enhancement Ideas

This document outlines creative UX improvements for different accessibility personas, with emphasis on eye gaze users and alternative interaction flows.

## Eye Gaze User Enhancements

### Dwell-Based Interactions
- **Dwell-to-Activate**: Look at a block for 800ms to enter sticky mode (alternative to double-click)
- **Gaze Trails**: Show a fading trail of where the user's gaze has been, helping them trace intended connection paths
- **Dwell Zones**: Larger invisible areas around connection points that activate on gaze dwell
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Looking at a block for different durations reveals different interaction options (short=select, medium=move, long=menu)

### Predictive Assistance
- **Gaze Path Prediction**: Analyze gaze patterns to predict likely connection targets and pre-highlight them
- **Smart Magnetism**: Blocks become "magnetic" to connection points the user has gazed at recently
- **Intention Detection**: If user gazes at Block A, then Block B, assume they want to connect them and offer a "auto-connect" option

### Gaze-Optimized Workflows
- **Parking Zones**: Temporary areas to "park" blocks while considering connections (reduces cognitive load)
- **Gaze-Based Context Menus**: Looking at a block corner brings up contextual options without clicking
- **Eye-Controlled Zoom**: Gaze at workspace edges to pan/zoom, reducing need for separate controls

## Motor-Impaired User Enhancements

### Enhanced Click-and-Stick Variants
- **Hover-and-Stick**: Mouse hover for 1 second activates sticky mode (no clicking needed)
- **Single-Click Mode**: First click picks up, second click anywhere drops (no double-click needed)
- **Gesture Recognition**: Simple mouse gestures (circle, line) for different actions
- **Auto-Align Mode**: Blocks automatically align to grid/guides when moving

### Tremor-Friendly Features
- **Stability Zones**: Areas where small movements are ignored/smoothed
- **Intent Confirmation**: "Are you sure?" dialogs for potentially unintended actions
- **Generous Undo**: Very forgiving undo system with long timeouts
- **Macro Connections**: Pre-defined block combinations available as single operations

## Multi-Modal Accessibility Ideas

### Voice Integration
- **Voice + Gaze**: "Connect this to that" while gazing at two blocks
- **Voice Commands**: "Move the loop block to the motor section"
- **Dictated Logic**: "If the button is pressed, then turn on the LED" auto-creates block structure

### Switch User Support
- **Scanning Mode**: Highlight blocks in sequence, switch press to select
- **Two-Switch Operation**: One switch for navigation, one for action
- **Hold-and-Scan**: Hold switch to scan connection targets for selected block

### Cognitive Load Reduction
- **Guided Mode**: Step-by-step tutorials with automated highlighting
- **Template Library**: Pre-built common patterns (if-then, loops, etc.)
- **Visual Chunking**: Group related blocks with visual containers
- **Progress Indicators**: Show completion status for complex block assemblies

## Advanced Eye Gaze Concepts

### Gaze Analytics Integration
- **Heat Maps**: Show where users commonly look when building certain patterns
- **Attention Modeling**: Predict what block types user needs based on current gaze focus area
- **Cognitive Load Detection**: Detect confusion patterns in gaze movement and offer help

### Eye Tracking Hardware Features
- **Blink Commands**: Deliberate blinks for actions (single blink = confirm, double blink = cancel)
- **Pupil Dilation**: Detect high cognitive load and simplify interface
- **Smooth Pursuit**: Use eye movement patterns to indicate dragging intentions

### Collaborative Features
- **Gaze Sharing**: In educational settings, teacher can see student's gaze patterns
- **Pair Programming**: Two users can work together with shared gaze visualization
- **Remote Assistance**: Helper can see where user is looking to provide better guidance

## Implementation Priorities

### High Impact, Low Complexity
1. Hover-and-stick mode
2. Single-click mode
3. Dwell-to-activate
4. Generous undo system

### Medium Impact, Medium Complexity
1. Parking zones
2. Auto-align mode
3. Gaze trails
4. Progressive disclosure

### High Impact, High Complexity
1. Voice integration
2. Gaze path prediction
3. Switch scanning mode
4. Collaborative features

## Notes
- Focus on reducing precision requirements
- Provide multiple interaction pathways for same action
- Leverage unique capabilities of different input methods
- Maintain core visual programming experience
- Consider cognitive load alongside motor limitations
